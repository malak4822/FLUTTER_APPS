## Description
Project have over 5880 lines of code. “Praktyki Szkolne” is an app developed over 10 months with the primary aim of assisting young students in securing school apprenticeships. It was born out of the scarcity of opportunities for students to gain real-world job experience in the market. Personally, I encountered significant challenges in finding apprenticeships, which served as the main impetus behind creating the app.

## Description
The problem with watching UFC from a country other than America is the time difference. Viewers sometimes just want to watch only one fight which will be at night. Users don't know exactly when their chosen fight will occur because the duration of fights sometimes varies. This app solves this problem by waking up the viewer at the exact time for their chosen fight. It does this by downloading data about the end of the fight before the chosen fight, and then wakes up the user.

## Used To Do App
- Push Notification
- Api & Scraping Data
- Shared Preferences Package

## Actions
This is a Flutter project. The app downloads fighters' data by scraping data using HTTP requests and also uses an external fight scores API. Project was started but never completed due to other projects.

## Description
The Clone App is a fun Flutter application cloned from a concept seen in the music video ‘Błąd’ by Łona and Webber. Its primary purpose is for amusement and learning. A fun fact is that when I was releasing the app on Google Play, I noticed that someone had the exact same idea and had created a similar application which has over a thousand downloads.
